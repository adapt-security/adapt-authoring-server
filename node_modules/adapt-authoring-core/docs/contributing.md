## Ways to contribute

### Report issues

Found a bug? Have an idea for a feature? Submit it to the relevant repository:

- [Adapt authoring tool](https://github.com/adapt-security/adapt-authoring/issues)
- [Adapt Framework](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/issues)

Before submitting, search existing issues to avoid duplicates. When reporting bugs, include steps to reproduce, expected behaviour, and actual behaviour.

### Fix issues

If you're a developer, fixing existing issues is a great way to contribute. Check out the issue trackers for bugs labelled with difficulty ratings:

- `D: beginner` / `D: easy` — Good starting points for newcomers
- `D: medium` — For developers comfortable with Node.js
- `D: hard` / `D: insane` — Complex issues requiring deep codebase knowledge

See [Contributing Code](contributing-code) for the complete guide on submitting code changes.

### Write documentation

Clear documentation helps everyone. If you spot something that could be improved, or want to write new guides, we'd love your help. You don't need to be a developer — just a willingness to explain things clearly.

### Help others

Share your knowledge in the forums and chat rooms. Answering questions is one of the most valuable contributions you can make.
